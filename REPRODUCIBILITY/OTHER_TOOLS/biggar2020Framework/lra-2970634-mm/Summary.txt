The files provided here contain the source code for our implementation of the methods in the paper, along with a Jupyter Notebook showing the execution and output from the example presented in section VI. The code gives an example of how these methods could be implemented. The Jupyter Notebook file (BT_Verification_Example.ipynb) augments the discussion given in section VI of the paper by showing the execution of the code on the example presented in that section.
